little bit inside baseball but typically when you're testing a new product an unreleased product from Apple they tell you to keep the testing a secret don't let anyone know you have it don't display it publicly don't show it to anyone that would be breaking the NDA and that's still true about this new iPhone 14 pro but I'll tell you what I was able to walk around take pictures text people pay for things with Apple pay and nobody even blinked an eye because it looks exactly the same as the iPhone 13 Pro this is still of course a new phone though for a new year and so really there are three major things that are new with the 14 pro those being the internals the display and the cameras and so I'm going to sort of chapter those things off to go over each of them but of course also worth mentioning is this new MKBHD Edition Chevron hoodie finally finally available in the MKBHD store mkbhd.com it's very comfortable but also hoodie season [Music] yeah on and on so there's not a whole lot of new pieces in this new phone but there's technically more in this one than the Baseline iPhone 14 because this one actually gets the Silicon upgrade to the new a16 bionic and six gigs of RAM top of the line new four nanometer system on a chip from Apple you could tell though when they gave the presentation in the keynote that it must be a pretty minor bump from the a15 bionic because they went straight to comparing it to the a13 bionic from a couple years ago in real life though so far it's benchmarked very similar to an a15 bionic just slightly above as expected and that's meant for me Rock Solid performance fluid animations and are pretty reliable all-day battery life from both the 14 pro and 14 pro Max but I'm going to get more into battery in a minute also technically new to the internals is a new set of sensors it's an improved gyroscope and a better accelerometer to be able to tell if you've been in a car crash or Not Crash detection cool feature so it'll detect if you've been in a car crash or not and then if you don't respond to the prompts on screen it'll automatically call Emergency Services great I'm not going to test that I'm sure some other YouTubers will find a way to test it but actually my question really was like okay if you're going to test it what sort of things do you test and I guess the answer is accidental triggers like you know how you'll if you run up a flight of stairs or something and you have automatic workout detection on the Apple watch it'll go oh have you started a workout because you've got an elevated heart rate and you just started to running no just me I don't know I was just wondering if there's other times I might accidentally think that's something else like a car crash might have happened maybe you've got a dbrand case on it and you just drop it on the floor or something I don't know it hits the ground hard enough thinks it might have crashed but then the more you look at it the more you realize there's a bunch of different sensors and factors where it sees okay your GPS location was going 60 miles an hour until it hit zero miles an hour and the microphones heard a loud noise and the barometric pressure changed when the airbags went off and also the gyroscope saw that there was a hard stopping force it knows you run a car crash one more thing that used to be in the iPhone that's not anymore and this one is a physical SIM card tray this is actually for the US only and these phones are now e-sim only esim isn't exactly a new thing but not having a physical SIM tray anymore does have its pros and cons pros mainly being okay it's one less place for water to get in one less moving part but cons being that for international travel if you just wanted to grab a SIM card real quick instead of going through the carriers that's no longer nearly as easy I'm going to keep an eye on this because I imagine Apple intends to eventually expand this to all iPhones instead of what it's now which is just starting in the US only but then the last internal change for the iPhone 14s all of them is satellite connectivity this is an edge case extra feature that you're honestly hoping you never ever have to use but in the off chance that you're stranded somewhere with absolutely no cellular service at all you're nowhere near a cell tower the iPhone's antenna is now impressively can also communicate with straight up satellites instead of cell towers so it'll take longer and you'll need a clear view of the sky and the UI will literally help you point your phone at a certain satellite overhead but it will let you send messages to a dispatcher or local emergency services to help get to your location and what you need help with that is also pretty clutch I will also not be testing that but that's it for internals uh notice I didn't talk much about the externals like I usually do in phone reviews because if we're being honest they're pretty much the same uh there are some new colors the space black which is my favorite in years and there's also a new purple color from certain angles you can hardly even tell it's purple but if it hits the light you know for a pro phone that's a solid purple I guess really only the camera bumps change they are definitely slightly larger and thicker than the 13 Pros but bottom line is when an iPhone 13 Pro can fit in an iPhone 14 Pro's case and you know it's pretty close in return okay so now we're really getting into the meat of what you really start to notice on these new phones iPhone 14 pro and 14 pro Max have some slightly updated 6.1 inch and 6.7 inch OLED displays respectively so there's still excellent displays on paper with slightly thinner bezels that you won't notice and slightly higher resolution that you also won't notice and an even higher brighter 2000 nits Peak brightness that you absolutely will notice when looking at the phone on like a bright sunny day it looks great at 100 out in the sun but the two things you'll notice the most often here are the dynamic Island and the always-on display the always-on display is the perfect example of the classic apple late mover strategy like this is not a new feature this has been on hundreds of phones before for many years but now it's finally coming to an iPhone and so it's being done the apple way this time the thing is I don't really know that there's any advantages to this apple way so the always on display looks like this so you hit the power button you sleep the phone you put it down the brightness drops the ltpo OLED display goes all the way down to one Hertz and you get to see the clock and notifications roll in as if your lock screen is still on just at a lower brightness this is a pretty bright always-on display though you can see that right like it you get used to it after a few days but I constantly was looking over at my phone on my desk thinking it was still on which is like a lower brightness but yeah it looks like that all the time the transition from the home screen to the always on display is really nice it's got this smooth fade animation and I think that's the Apple Way like the clock if it's behind something will graduate to the front of the oasan display and it maintains all the colors and skin tones and whatever wallpaper you were using so it's not faded or black and white you still have all your color if you've got music playing then your album art is front and center it is extra beautiful but I don't really care about any of that to be honest and there's also no extra customization like I've seen some really creative always-on displays over the years that let me customize and dial in even differently from the lock screen and I really love using them apples is just a toggle in the display settings on or off that's it me personally I'm gonna be turning it off on this phone because it also seems to be affecting battery life slightly more than I expected now the always-on display specifically doesn't show up in the battery settings so I'm kind of just estimating here based on my behavior everything else looks normal but I am getting slightly worse battery life than I've expected and then I've had on the 13 Pro for the past year and so I assume that's this that's a little extra brightness gone a long way it does still know when to turn off don't get me wrong if it's in a pocket it turns off if you're in sleep mode it turns off even when you have an Apple Watch on and you walk far enough away from the phone that it knows you can't see it anymore it turns off the always-on display but it does just sit here on my desk all day showing me stuff and I I don't really use it all that much so yeah I'm gonna pass but you know what is new on the screen that I absolutely love and will never pass on the dynamic Island baby what a terrible name they felt the need to name the notch it is such a minor feature in the grand scheme of using a phone but it's a good one it's a really good one so here's what's happening remember the rumors of the new Pro iPhone replacing the notch with an eye shaped cutout in the top of the display with all those renders people made well that's actually what this is it has one circular cut out on the right for a new selfie camera and one pill-shaped cutout on the left for the new face ID Hardware which they've shrunk down by about 30 percent to fill in this smaller area and then instead of just doing that Apple has cleverly decided to fill in the gap between them with black pixels and make it one big pill so then the idea is Apple would much rather think about the pill as software than Hardware so they built a whole bunch of software features around it so it just has a resting state like this which doesn't show up in screenshots or screen recordings it's just a gap but there are about 30 different things that it does to indicate ongoing activities and background activities and things that are all beautifully animated and super smooth these fluid physics it's so friendly and approachable and all of these things that it does show up in screenshots and Screen recordings the best part is pretty much everything works straight out the box as you'd expect it to so I had this moment during the first impressions video where I was like oh can't wait for Apple music to use it but then Spotify to take like a year and a half to actually update their app to work with this but nope everything works straight out the box including Spotify because that already uses the now playing API they already had a lock screen widget same with SoundCloud same with YouTube music and Pocket Casts so you have album art and the color matching waveform up there while the media is playing if you tap it it'll open the app that's playing and if you long press it you actually get a widget that pops up with some media controls I can scrub and everything pretty much the exact same widget that would appear in the lock screen so this feels kind of backwards I think a tap should open the widget and then a long press should open the app and that would just make more sense but whatever the point is it just works right off the rip matter of fact here's everything that the dynamic Island does right out the box on day one so it does system alerts like for incoming calls connecting air pods plugging into a charger switching the ringer to silent mode or volume on face ID unlocking connecting air pods and a whole bunch more there's our full list and then it's also a UI for live activities happening in the background so an ongoing call or music playing in the background any media a timer counting down Maps directions as you navigate in the background what voice memos recording screen recording all that stuff so here's a full list of that as well and then any third-party app that uses the now playing or call Kit apis which there are many it also has a little spot for the indicator for microphone and camera access right in between the pill and the cutout it really becomes next level when you have multiple background activities happening at once because then it low-key kind of becomes like a multitasking app switcher at the top of your phone so one background activity looks like this but then if I have a second one if I go start a new background activity it splits the island into two so now you can pick between them and then quickly swap between them with a single touch that's so sick I think as cheesy as the name is like I'm about done saying the words Dynamic Island out loud but I think this will be one of the most copied features in the smartphone World in like 18 months pretty much guarantee it like we even already saw some MIUI mods on Twitter where people trying this on other phones but the thing is it's going to be surprisingly hard to copy it exactly like this on this level it seems pretty innocuous pretty simple but there is a lot going on here like there's a new display engine in the a16 bionic that handles all these animations and there's a lot of them that really pull this whole thing together there's physics to it you just you poke the cut out and it wobbles and moves around a little like it's alive and since there are real cutouts like holes in the display for the camera and the face ID system it has to be touch sensitive in areas around the actual cutout so that it can still register Taps when you touch a dead zone on the screen and for the most part it works pretty well is this a game changing feature in a phone for most people no is this a reason to get one phone over another I don't think so no not really is this a nice quality of life touch that a lot of people will think is really cool and really like yeah yeah I think that's true is this feature technically invented by LG seven years ago with the top screen on the LG V10 yes absolutely [Music] all right if you watch enough iPhone presentations then you know that the pro iPhone really is and has been all about the cameras fun fact they spent 23 minutes on stage at the September event talking about the iPhone 14 pro and seven of those minutes about 33 percent we're just talking about the camera and so this is the biggest change at least on paper that's been made to the iPhone camera in many years look at this graph this is a graph of the megapixel count of every iPhone camera since they first came out they've been confidently repeating the 12 megapixel sensors since the iPhone 6s but this year we got a leap we got the leap the primary camera on the iPhone 14 pro is now a new 48 megapixel sensor it's 65 percent larger than the one we had on the 12 Pro it has a second generation Focus Shift Optical image stabilization 100 Focus pixels and sits behind a new f 1.78 lens I think we can all agree that's a great set of specs that we expect great imagery from but really The more I've been playing with it it's just more about what the new 48 megapixel sensor enables that's so great so a new larger 48 megapixel sensor that's going to bend down to 12 megapixels for all your normal photos but you do get the benefits of sharpness and more light Gathering From a larger sensor that also gives you faster shutter speeds to freeze motion more often in non-perfect conditions and it lets me take low light photos with a shorter shutter time which is very convenient but the larger sensor also gives you a really nice shallow natural depth of field without portrait mode more than we've ever seen from an iPhone camera now other phones I've seen do this just as well but it presents a new set of challenges like fringing and autofocus but I've been very impressed with how well the iPhone deals with both not a whole ton of fringing on close-up subjects and 100 coverage with Focus pixels has been pretty locked in on tracking subjects and keeping things in Focus even with the shallow depth of field my only complaint really is the pretty weak minimum Focus distance things get blurred when you get close to the primary camera so you got to switch to the macro mode pretty early luckily the ultra wide has some improvements too so that's not the end of the world then a 48 megapixel sensor also enables this new 2x button doesn't seem like that huge of a deal but it's literally just cropping in on the middle 12 megapixels of this huge sensor so it's essentially like an optical zoom it's not like you're going to lose quality the way anything less than 3x would have been before on iPhones because it was cropping into an already 12 megapixel image the 48 megapixel sensor also enables this new action mode and video which is this super aggressive stabilization for really shaky video and it does this with a pretty heavy crop but it's also able to still shoot in up to 2.8 K in this mode a little Pro tip it defaults to the 0.5 x camera it's much noisier when you do this so so I I do recommend switching back to the primary for it and then if you're running around chasing a subject or even pulling it out a car window or just anytime you need some pretty heavy stabilization this is definitely nice to have if you want the full 48 megapixel files you can shoot in Pro raw and it will kick out 50 60 70 megabyte dng files which have a lot of detail and latitude to push around in Lightroom and make them look better than the straight out of Camera 12 megapixel shots but I'll leave that to the Peter McKinnon's and Tyler stalman's or many other photography creators I know are going to put this to the test one thing they didn't do with the new 48 megapixel sensor is 8k video they could have they've not been able to until they crossed the 30 megapixel threshold they got to 48 they didn't do it that of course would also probably still be pretty tough considering the max iPhone is still one terabyte which sounds like a lot but then you're also working with huge five six gig per minute prores files that take forever to get off the iPhone via this lightning port in the slow speeds and they should probably just switch to USBC and that's a whole rant for another day so I'll just stop it there but just know no AK video straight from the iPhone's camera I think I can honestly safely though put the iPhone 14 pro as the best camera system in any phone in 2022. don't get me wrong it's not perfect it can definitely over bake HDR sometimes in some harsh shooting conditions and the new selfie camera which now has 12 megapixels and autofocus while it handles a variety of focal lengths much better and is sharper overall it still has a tendency to overexpose people with dark skin constantly I would know but if I'm just looking for the overall versatility of the whole camera system you know the shutter speed improvements the quality of the photos the great autofocus the color consistency between the three different cameras the overall image processing pipeline improvements that have made the ultra wide much more usable and less noisy and low light and then of course the prores video that I'm literally actively running an entire YouTube channel with then yeah I'm pretty comfortable calling this the camera King again and yes I am going to be shooting the new autofocus video with the iPhone 14 Pros cameras so if you want to large helping of sample footage that's going to be the place to go go subscribe over there plus the car is going to be that's a fun one it's going to be a good video so don't miss it anyway oh also guess what guess what cinematic mode now supports 30 FPS huh that's funny Checkmate 24 FPS stands uh no but also I don't think I'm gonna be using cinematic mode that much because the natural depth of field is so good on the primary camera but yeah 30 FPS cinematic now also remember how all those event invites went out a couple weeks ago and the theme was far out and there were all these stars and we thought oh they're going to get an astrophotography mode like a nighttime photography type thing uh that didn't happen turned out they were like hinting at the satellite connectivity but like the iPhone still gets crushed when it comes to some of the like super low light nighttime shooting and especially astrophotography so I'm kind of bummed that we didn't get that but otherwise yeah complete camera [Music] so the iPhone 14 pro is still a thousand dollars and the 14 pro Max is still eleven hundred dollars to start so they are the absolute best phones Apple makes right now and there's going to be a lot of people considering an upgrade so is it worth it well in the landscape of other phones you could get for one thousand dollars this one's gonna be competitive it's going to have the best camera of the bunch I think uh it's gonna have one of the best brightest most responsive displays of any of those phones it's also going to have a dynamic Island however you feel about that but also it's going to have the classic Suite of iPhone stuff iMessage FaceTime Classics but there definitely isn't any any flashy or any Crazy Design or Hardware Innovation Happening Here There is nothing folding in half there is no super fast charging or some massive battery size Improvement the new colors which you've seen are like yeah you can kind of tell that they're a little different looking but this is a very refined update and so really the truth is if you have an iPhone 11 or later at this point then the new iOS 16 update pushing out to your phone right now is gonna make just as big of a difference to the user experience of using your phone as getting the new phone probably would so yeah I'd say you know the new lock screen the haptic keyboard all this stuff I did a video on all the new features you can check that out but yeah this is a really good phone you should get it if you either want the latest and greatest and best of a smartphone camera available right now or if you've just got a thousand dollar hole in your pocket burning away and you just have to have the latest and greatest pro iPhone that's what this is if you're not trying to get the newest iPhone then you can skip the upgrade it and fix your current phone with parts and tools by

but either way that's been it thanks for watching definitely get subscribed to see the straight up standard iPhone 14 review and that comes out also the Apple watch Ultra and that comes out and about

'start': 608, 'end': 621}], 'full_transcript': \" the world's been buzzing about the new iPhone 14 it's a very impressive phone and there are a lot of little details that I found that I want to share with you guys so let's start off with the screens the iPhone 14 Pro Models get much brighter this year last year's device had a fairly decent brightness Outdoors already but when you compare them side by side it's a massive difference it hits 2000 hits this year it gets Wicked bright you know sometimes when you're outside and you turn on your phone it looks kind of dim so you try to crank the brightness but it's already maxed out on the 14 pro there's no more visibility issues Outdoors it does get a little warm though when it's blasting out those 2000 nits now the most visually noticeable difference this year is going to be that pill-shaped cutout up front and they've given it the name Dynamic Island and contained on this island is a front-facing camera as well as other face ID Hardware like the dot projector and then below that island is their Pro motion ocean as well as a little retina River above the island so this island can smoothly transform between a whole slew of different notifications they're very well animated and they look super cool a lot of stuff works right out of the box but technically it's just a software widget isn't it like it seems like they could have taken a widget and positioned and animated in a way to mask the visual imperfection of front-facing camera so when I first started using it I was like can I really call this a feature like if I took this widget and just place it on any other phone out there you could do that right and what I call that a phone feature but the more I use this I realized that the value of dynamic Island and what makes it special on the iPhone is how and when the elements pop in and out because with this you get to Monitor and control or just keep track of a whole bunch of different things without it interrupting your flow like you could be doing something on your phone and these notifications will automatically bubble in so you can just kind of check up on them and poke at them if you need to and then they'll bubble out automatically when you need them without any kind of like tapping or pulling down menus it's very fluid and it's all done seamlessly around that cutout I think it really is a feature I think it's like the best notification system the iPhone has ever had whether or not that's enough to motivate a purchase I guess that depends on how much you value a really good notification system on the iPhone uh one other thing if you have the display tilted on the side and you say you're watching a movie or just using your phone in landscape mode some notifications will actually animate out from that Island like it'll Bubble Up do its thing show its thing and then it'll animate back into the island one of the concerns that you guys mentioned in my previous video was like how do movies and shows look with that Island because like doesn't it get in the way so normal Media or like a lot of normal media doesn't even go into that area it's only when you kind of zoom in or you're watching stuff with like a wide aspect ratio that actually even comes over to that segment now for me I'll be honest when content does spill over I kind of prefer the way the notched looks so because the notch is just like a black segment that's at the very edge of of the screen it's kind of easier to ignore or at least mentally tune out but with this because it's like this black section and there's like a sliver of action I do think it's a little harder to ignore now the front facing camera this has improved that now has autofocus it handles uh colors a little bit better but for me the thing that I noticed that I think it handles contrast much better than previous generations so as an example I have black hair with a sprinkling of gray I'm old AF but on the old iPhone when I took photos with that front-facing camera sometimes it would make it look like I had tons of gray hairs like it was somehow being tricked by the surrounding light into thinking that I had like a bunch of light colored gray hairs and it was so weird I would take photos and be like I don't look anything like this this time around on the iPhone 14 pro it is much more accurate to true life it's such a small detail but makes a huge difference in how that image looks nobody wants to look like they're 15 years older than they actually are alright the always-on displays the iPhone 14 Pros finally have aod they relate to the game but they finally made it and they've done it in a very Apple implementation when you hit the sleep wake button there's a bit of an animation and the clock will tighten up and come out to the foreground if it was hidden the flashlight and the camera buttons disappear and the lock screen will dim down now the thing is Apple's iPhones are usually very focused on Energy Efficiency and the introduction of a feature like an always on display is interesting because now the user base has access to a feature that invariably uses more energy than it did before right it doesn't matter how awesome that one Hertz ltpo display is in terms of like sipping energy this is going to suck more juice than if you didn't have an always-on display right but there is this really interesting thing I noticed with iOS 16. I'm not sure it's related but in previous versions of iOS including iOS 15 if you had a light colored background you would have black text on the home screen it makes sense right you have a light colored background darken the text for legibility right but for whatever reason with iOS 16 they changed it so let me show you real quick if you have if you have a light colored background the text of all the stuff in the home screen is still white it's crazy and what they've done is they've put this drop shadow underneath all the white text and this just does not make sense from a design perspective it's just like why would you do this and this has never existed before any iOS version until I was 16. and during the beta I was looking this like this doesn't make sense I couldn't figure out why they would do this but maybe just maybe they're encouraging people to use dark backgrounds to counteract the extra battery consumption that comes from and always on display I'm just saying it's interesting that this feature was introduced just when always on displays came to the iPhone now I can't measure exactly how much juice is being used by the aod but in terms of overall battery performance the new iPhones put up excellent run times but not any longer than the iPhone models from last year at least not with my testing Loop okay the camera system so with the iPhone 14 pro it seems to be one of the biggest camera upgrades they've made in a while you now have a 48 megapixel sensor paired with their new photonic engine image processing and with that sensor you can shoot

are going to get bent down to 12 megapixel files and in normal lighting conditions you get really clean looking images excellent depth of field and the dynamic range is so much better on the 14 pro

than Android and it makes you do double the swiping to get to them one-handed but those notifications always hit my iPhone first Gmail Google Voice Instagram DM you name it the iPhone lets me know within moments while my Android phones might not tell me for many long minutes thereafter you know I'm often asked by the 70 of global smartphone users who use Android why 50 of Americans prefer the iPhone and all that stuff I just mentioned factors in in a big way there's also a darker side to the iPhone lock-in question which I'll cover in a second but first I want to touch on the cameras and I do mean touch on because honestly these cameras are more of the same which is very good news for the camcorder crew for several years I've reserved a permanent slot in my Peak design bag just for the iPhone because for someone like me who needs to shoot a lot of lifestyle and product footage on the go but doesn't want to carry a dedicated camera and hates over complicated user interfaces absolutely nothing beats the iPhone for video the past few weeks with 14 pro have given me the opportunity to capture all kinds of Shenanigans in every possible lighting condition the after dark birth of an artery threatening culinary creation I've named the pizza burger you laughed at me you called me all sorts of names but my first bite of this was nothing short of heavenly and I think this is the new reality I don't want to admit it the overcast mid-afternoon tour of my soon to be new neighborhood in Brooklyn from Sun shower to double Dumbo rainbow the sun soaked San Diego engagement of some dear friends that you should know if you don't already congrats Josh and Issa congrats thank you I told you this yesterday and of course all the travels at all the altitudes in between the much balihood autofocus on the selfie camera hasn't made too notable a difference in my own usage but I will give a well-earned shout out to the new action mode stabilization which kept the shot steady even on this bumpy approach LaGuardia Shaman couldn't do anything about the perpetually dirty Windows of skywest's pretty naturally tiny crj-900s but one step at a time are there downsides of course you've no doubt noticed that lens flare is still pronounced on these cameras and I expect Google's brand new pixel 7 to bring some serious heat in low light photography when it launches later this month also the iPhone's 3x Zoom is weak compared to the competition from Samsung still switching between those cameras is even smoother than it already was which can make for even silkier sponsorship Segways that's for you Adam that's for you yes indeed if the iPhone isn't gonna look any different by itself well at least you can do something about it this video is sponsored by dbrand and the new palettes collection by Ali abdall it's light mode done right whether you scan the phone directly or the dbrand grip case that gives you that added protection debrand your device at the link in the description three weeks ago I gave you a quick look at the three biggest changes to the iPhone 14 pro and since then the dynamic island has definitely come out on top of those three even as we wait for Apple to provide the live activities API to unlock the Island's true potential some developers have already kicked off the fun and witnessed the tamagotchi-like kitty for the Apollo Reddit client or the pong-like hit the island game which reminds me of some of the very first apps for the iPhone and its Simplicity and addictive properties this might bother me more if I watched more full screen video but overall I continue to think this is an excellent approach to dealing with the eyesore of the oversized hole punch and like the satellite-based emergency SOS feature due to roll out later this year it's a good feeling knowing the phone's feature set will grow over time the other changes not so much I thought I'd get used to the new always on display but three weeks later I'm still getting fooled multiple times a day into thinking I have a new message waiting because it's just too similar to The Standard lock screen I mean I love the look of some of these options and I'm not seeing the battery hit that others have reported in the iPhone 14 pro routinely outlasts the fold 4 and flip 4 I use on a daily basis but on the whole I continue to prefer Android manufacturers always on displays for Quick Glance ability that I don't have to go out of my way to customize and if the cameras in the ecosystem weren't going to keep an iPhone in your pocket well the new embedded Sim might and no that's not a compliment before a recent flight I tried swapping from the 14 pro to the pro Max before takeoff and well the process soaked up 20 minutes between boarding and pushback and was so full of bugs that I actually lost service on both phones when I took off I didn't have a phone number it got fixed later on and to be fair this is an edge case but anyone who says this process which by the way requires an internet connection on both phones is somehow easier than taking 20 seconds to swap a physical card that's just not true oh and as discovered by iFixit Apple did nothing with the space it saved by removing the physical SIM tray assembly in this year's design Ed with imessage lock-in and Apple's stubborn refusal to abandon its lightning connector in favor of the type C Port used by almost every other product including the iPad this forced move toward esim feels like just another way to make it harder for iPhone users to leave the Apple ecosystem now that's speculation on my part but let's remember a bit of History here research in motion's Blackberry devices were famously so addictive that people called them crack berries and they were once so ubiquitous that Blackberry accounted for over 50 percent of U.S smartphones and 20 percent of the global share sound familiar blackberry's fall was as Swift as it was devastating and Apple's effort to avoid a similar Fate by doing everything it can to keep people from leaving its ecosystem makes a lot of business sense when I use the iPhone 14 pro I'm put in mind of how I felt when I was trying to review the new Macbook Pro I have a hard time romanticizing it or Conjuring up the flowery word play that I might use to describe the bleeding edge devices that I actually prefer to carry because the iPhone doesn't appeal to the part of me that wants to be reminded that he's living in the future it appeals to the part of me that sees a phone as a tool for getting things done will it get me to switch from Android no but honestly it wasn't made for me someone who values a choice in form factors at the very Forefront of the mobile Frontier it was made for Apple users who haven't upgraded in two years or more and you know want the new one it's a minimum viable permutation and if it were a regular phone that might be an insult but it's not a regular phone it's the iPhone and for the Target customer that's enough for now [Music] this review was produced following 21 days with an iPhone 14 pro review sample provided by Apple but as always the manufacturer had no creative control or indeed

take up some place in the front of the display here's the thing about the notch though in almost every review going back to the iphone 10 i've said hey after a couple minutes you know notice the notch

you are going to pay attention to it well it turns out that over the years there have been like three or four different status indicator systems added on to ios plugging in a charger or flipping the mute switch brings up an overlay having a call in the background puts a green pill in the corner the maps app is a blue pill connecting airpods is another overlay some things like timers and music playing in the background haven't really had status indicators at all the island is apple's way of replacing and unifying all those older status systems with a new home for system alerts and making it work for things like music and the new live activities api that's coming to ios 16 later this year which will allow apps to share even more background info for things like your flight status or a sports score the simplest way of understanding the island is it's basically a new widget system built on top of that live activities api and the widgets can have three views the main view this expanded view and this ultra minimal icon when you've got two things going at once here's a list apple sent over of all the things that will support the island at launch before live activities arrives

effect for when the island splits in two are super fun in sunlight or brighter light yeah you can see the camera sensors the illusion kind of goes away but it's still cool other big thing that works is that moving all these disparate status indicators to the island and making them worth paying attention to is actually pretty great it's nice having call info right on the screen it's genuinely useful having your timers right there making things like airdrop and face id all show up in consistent ways in the same place make those things easier to understand which is great the thing that kills me is that in the keynote and all the ads apple shows the island is a thing that's worth interacting with it's always moving and going back and forth between the main view and the expanded view in reality it is not like that at all the island isn't a primary interface element it sits over whatever app you're actually using and apps are still very much the main point of the iphone in fact tapping on the island doesn't open that expanded view it just switches you back to whatever app that controls the widget to get the expanded view you have to tap and hold this feels exactly backwards to me now apple knows i feel this way the idea apparently is that things should be as simple as possible and going back to the app is the simplest thing i don't know i think a tap should pop open the widget and i definitely think you should at least be able to choose this is kind of the whole tension of the island it's much more noticeable and useful than the notch but you're not really supposed to interact with it it's background information all those questions about whether you're gonna get fingerprints over the camera like well as it stands you don't touch this thing very much at all but because it's so much more prominent you're looking at it all the time i'm using it with a bunch of apps that haven't been updated so it kind of covers up some content because it sits lower on the display so right at this second the trade-off between how noticeable it is and how useful it is a little out of whack it doesn't quite do enough to always be in the way now i think all this might change when that live activities api rolls out later this year which is the other big thing apple did right it made this system available to third-party developers but right now the dynamic island feels like one of those things that needs a year of refinement and developer attention before we really know how important it is the big feature of the iphone 14 pro camera system is the new 48 megapixel main camera sensor apple's actually a few years late to this trend samsung has used 108 megapixel sensors since 2020 and google added a 50 megapixel sensor to the pixel 6 pro last year the basic idea is the same all around to take better photos you need to collect as much light as possible and to do that you need bigger pixels but at some point making the pixels physically bigger gets hard so instead you just add a lot more pixels and use software to group them into giant virtual pixels this whole thing is called pixel bidding and the math on apple spinning is straightforward it uses four pixels to create a single virtual pixel which means that 48 megapixel sensor generally shoots 12 megapixel photos apple's also reworked its entire photo processing pipeline and rebranded it the photonic engine the big change here is that the deep fusion pixel by pixel analysis that happens in mid and low light now happens earlier in the process on uncompressed data it's never really been easy to see how much it's doing and well it's the same on the iphone 14 pro honestly the 14 pro and 13 pro take really similar photos here's verge video producer mario abdulkov in a really dim bar the 14 pro is a little cooler and it captures a tiny bit more detail at 100 percent you really have to go looking for it these photos of mario outside look pretty much the same but if you zoom in you can see the 14 pro is getting a bit more detail and it has a nicer background blur because of the substantially larger sensor this is all really nice but in instagram sizes it is not particularly noticeable here's that same photo on the pixel 6 pro by the way you can see it captures even more detail with its pixel bend 50 megapixel sensor along with a wider range of colors this is about as different as the pixel and the iphone have been in a few years they both grab a lot of detail and have great low light performance but the pixel 6 pro makes very different choices about highlights and shadow while the iphone is way more willing to let highlights blow out and even let some natural vignetting creep in both of these photos are terrific and the one you prefer is entirely down to subjective preference where the iphone 14 pro falls down is really in the details of the processing apple's been ramping up the amount of noise reduction and sharpening over the years and the 14 pro has the most aggressive sharpening and noise reduction yet sometimes it just looks bad this night skyline shot is kind of an over process mess compared to the pixel compared to the samsung s22 ultra the iphone is a little less predictable the s22 ultra consistently holds on to more color detail and low light it's not as heavy-handed with that noise reduction and sharpening in bright light the differences between the 14 pro and the s22 ultra are more subtle but samsung still does a better job with detail in true samsung fashion though you get much punchier and warmer colors compared to the more natural look of the iphone i mean look at these sunset photos samsung's color ideas are sometimes from an entirely different planet but photo for photo the s22 ultra is more consistent with better fine detail now apple isn't just pixel binning its sensor it's also cropping it to generate what it calls an optical quality 2x zoom basically it's just taking the middle 12 megapixels off that 48 megapixel sensor if you shoot and pro rot the full 48 megapixels and just cut out the center of the image you'll get the same photo you don't get the benefit of pixel binning in 2x mode so it gets into a little trouble in lower light situations but it's nice to have and it's a really nice middle ground between the standard and the 3x tele that 2x crop is now the default for portrait mode which doesn't seem to have improved all that much both the s22 ultra and even the regular s22 take better portrait photos samsung's really nailed cutting the subject out of the background down to individual strands of hair if 14 pro isn't quite there yet you can also switch the whole camera to pro raw mode and shoot in full 48 megapixel glory which generates massive dng files anywhere between 50 and 80 megs each if you're the sort of person who wants to do this this is incredibly exciting but normal people should probably not shoot 48 megapixel photos on their phone the other big update is to video but you know i called in the expert for that [Music] i'm just kind of having a hard time telling the difference the iphone 14 pro of course has great video i mean colors are punchy and bold with just the right amount of sharpness but all of the same could be said about the iphone 13 pro and outside of a much sharper image in low light from the telephoto i'm not really seeing a large jump in performance between the two but apple has three gimmicks for us this year first there's now an active mode that is supposed to provide more stable footage the pixel 6 pro had a similar feature but i find that video footage from most flagship phones in 2022 is already pretty stable certainly stable enough for mobile viewing so i never used it there and i probably won't use it here second there's this sort of smooth zoom feature that smooths out the transitions when you're switching between lenses it's cool once you notice it but i think that most folks won't notice it at all and lastly there's 4k cinematic mode it blurs the background just well enough that i actually found myself always trying that mode first when filming a video of a person's face with anything else i mean plants signs forget about it it's just not that smart yet but does it matter that it's in 4k for me it kind of does but i'm a person who's going to take that footage into premiere anyone else i don't think it matters overall though the 14 pros video is not upgrade worthy if you're coming from an iphone 13 pro and i think it would have been a little bit more beneficial if apple spent more time attempting to get rid of all of those light reflections at night and you know apple while you're at it why don't you add a button to your native camera app that allows you to switch between the front-facing camera and the rear camera when you're filming a video i mean samsung has had this feature for as long as i can remember it's time that iphone gets it too okay back to the review apple's made some other big changes to the iphone 14 pro the phone now has an always-on display mode which well android phones have had always on displays for a long time now it's fine the display refresh drops to just one hertz and the brightness goes super low to save battery life apple's done some really nice work here to keep wallpaper colors accurate in the low power mode but honestly i've been fooled into thinking my phone is awake one too many times and i might prefer a much simpler pixel style black and white clock i hope we see some customization options here in the future other than that the display is slightly brighter than before it can hit a peak brightness of 1600 nits up from 1213 pro and in bright sunlight it can go all the way up to 2000 nits you all know i think apple's mobile displays are consistently the best in the industry and it's no different here this is the part of the video where i'd usually talk about connectivity but can we all just admit that the 5g height balloon basically popped like i turn it off and just use lte because those networks are less congested sorry let me know when the self-driving cars are doing robot surgery or whatever anyway apple's made a big move to drop sim trays from iphones united states which means it's time everyone got used to esim which lets you access mobile networks without needing a physical sim card you can sign up for up to eight different networks on the iphone 14s it's pretty rad my iphone 14 pro transferred my atm t account over for my 13 right over bluetooth and i added my google fi account with just a handful of taps now it's not nearly as easy to move e-sim info from iphones to android phones and back again and carriers are certainly going to place some weirdo lock-in games here because their carriers and weirdo lock-in games are kind of why they exist but being able to add new networks quickly and easily to your phone also theoretically means we can all force the carriers to compete a little more that's definitely a good thing speaking of connectivity apple's emergency satellite connectivity system isn't rolling out until later this year but alison got an early demo on the apple campus and it looks pretty slick the system walks you through a series of questions to help first responders understand your situation then it shows you where to point the phone to access the satellite we've got way more on that in her review of the iphone 14. speaking of allison she's also been testing the iphone 14 pro while becca and i have tested the iphone 14 pro max and all three of us sort of feel like the battery runs down a little bit faster than the 13 pro now to be fair all three of us were running around taking lots of photos and videos generally testing the hell out of these phones for the past week but you know we test a lot of phones like that apple says the 14 pro and 14 pro max should get slightly better battery life than the 13 pros and yep i still got through a full day with the 14 pro max so maybe it was just the always on display taking a toll but it's something i'll be keeping my eye on in the future so that's the iphone 14 pro the way i've been thinking about it is that the iphone 13 pro was the culmination of a lot of ideas for apple it was confident and complete and kind of hard to criticize the iphone 14 pro on the other hand is the clear beginning of lots of new ideas like the dynamic island the new camera even that satellite connectivity system because these ideas are new they're inherently incomplete so there's lots to criticize but they're worth criticizing which is its own kind of victory and a sign that apple isn't holding still with the future of the iphone i'm into that what i don't know is if all these new features are worth it yet if you're the sort of person who's willing to accept some rough edges to be on the bleeding edge you're gonna have a lot of fun with the iphone 14 pro you'll be figuring it out right alongside apple but for everyone else might be worth holding off of here look at these clouds oh my god look at that look at those oh my god this stuff over here come on that is just so special\"}\n",

score\\nslightly better on benchmarksthan the regular Snapdragon\\n8 Gen 2, and that's nicefor a little extra headroom\\nfor high performance stuff,light gaming and for future-proofing,but that's not the whole story.There's two main things that matter here,one is efficiency gains.So, obviously performance is awesome,but because efficiency is better,these phones get some\\nserious battery life

Now, this phone, actually\\nthe whole S23 lineup, has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, a customized version of the chip, specifically for these Samsung phones. So if you watched the last video about how Apple\\'s taking back the iPhone, then you know already that optimization and customization for parts inside phones is a good thing, generally. But the only thing that we\\'ve really seen that is customized for\\nthis chip for Galaxy is a slightly higher max clock\\nspeed on the performance core and slightly higher\\nclock speed on the GPU. So to be exact, 3.36GHz instead of 3.2 on the performance core and\\n719MHz versus 680 on the GPU. So yeah, it does score\\nslightly better on benchmarks than the regular Snapdragon\\n8 Gen 2, and that\\'s nice for a little extra headroom\\nfor high performance stuff, light gaming and for future-proofing, but that\\'s not the whole story. There\\'s two main things that matter here, one is efficiency gains. So, obviously performance is awesome, but because efficiency is better, these phones get some\\nserious battery life gains that we\\'ll talk in a second. But also too, is bye-bye Exynos, because they\\'re not making an\\nExynos version of this phone as far as I can tell anywhere else. They\\'re shipping every S23\\nUltra with a Qualcomm chip, so everyone gets the efficiency and performance gains\\nfrom the Qualcomm version. So lemme tell you, the\\nbattery life on this phone is actually, it\\'s been incredible, like it\\'s really, really good. So it\\'s the 5,000 million power cell again shouldn\\'t be a surprise,\\nbut with this huge screen, I guess it kind of is actually a surprise. I had a two-day period at 120Hz but 1080P, where the only time I charged it was on the wireless charger in my car on the way to and from the studio for like the 40 minutes\\nthat that drive is. I didn\\'t charge it overnight\\nor anything like that. Two full packed days of high brightness, high intensity, normal use for me, has something like eight and a\\nhalf hours of screen-on time. I\\'m in bed at like 11:00 PM\\nat the end of the second day streaming on YouTube live watching LeBron break Kareem\\'s record, it\\'s still got like 10%\\nleft, it just won\\'t die. So combine this excellent battery life with a pretty solid 45 watt charging that can go zero to 100 in an\\nhour, plus wireless charging, and you\\'ve got yourself a\\nbattery monster, it\\'s super good. I don\\'t think enough people are talking about how much better the battery got. Maybe someone will do one of\\nthose crazy long runtime demos versus the past phone, but\\nyeah, it\\'s really good, probably better than you think. You kind of don\\'t ever\\nneed to switch to 1080P to save batteries, matter of fact, when you take it out of the box, immediately just go in\\nand switch it to 1440P, \\'cause you spent 1200 bucks on this phone, and it lasts forever, treat yourself. Okay anyway, that\\'s the chips,\\nthat\\'s what that enables, but there\\'s also a new set of cameras, hardware and software across the board that also is better than you think. Now, the fundamentals are mostly the same, which is why this\\nprobably gets written off so quickly a lot. The layout, the aesthetics,\\nthe focal lengths, the arrangement, it\\'s\\nall practically the same, but we have a new\\n200-megapixel primary camera with double the optical image\\nstabilization range as before. That\\'s hugely important. And then new sensors\\nacross the ultra wide, the 3X telephoto, and the\\n10X periscope cameras. This new primary sensor setup though, I know we keep saying\\ncameras are mostly software, and as far as the look\\nand style of the photos, it absolutely still\\nis, but the improvement to the stabilization is so important here. So when you go from a normal sensor to a super-high resolution\\n200-megapixel sensor, the fact is, in these\\ntiny smartphone cameras, the individual pixels are\\nso small that individually, they physically can\\'t\\nbring in that much light. So the camera does this\\nthing called binning, where it combines the information from a bunch of adjacent pixels to form larger more accurate\\npixels in your image. So you\\'re not shooting\\n200 megapixels by default, it\\'s actually binning 16 pixels into one, so you end up taking a 12.5 megapixel shot for normal photos, but each photo is theoretically more\\naccurate thanks to its makeup. And then like I said, the\\nstabilization performance on this new primary camera has doubled. (phone rattles) Still rattles a little bit,\\nbut that means it\\'ll correct up to three degrees of shake\\nnow versus the 1.5 from before, so here\\'s an example of what\\'s happening. If you get a lens with really good optical\\nimage stabilization, (lens rattles) like this one, that means it can\\ncorrect from the movement in your hand much more, which means you can hold the\\ncamera stable for much longer, so it can leave the shutter open to collect more light and\\nstill get a sharp photo. So, all of this is to say\\nGalaxy S23 Ultra photos, most of the time, in most lighting, look pretty similar to last year. So if that\\'s all you\\'re looking at, just normal side by sides,\\nthis is mostly gonna come down to the different software tuning, and there\\'s a little bit more\\ndynamic range than last year, but yeah, still top of the line while mostly avoiding looking to HDR-y. Photos are typically pretty\\nwarm from these Samsung phones, and they have a slightly punchier, more contrasty look than before, still very much up the Samsung alley of colorful and saturated,\\nbut it\\'s an aesthetic that I can get behind, I really like. But, on top of that,\\nhaving this new sensor and optical stabilization means one, you can shoot literally\\n200-megapixel photos now if you really want to. Now, this does accomplish\\nthe intended purpose of capturing much more of the finer detail in things like landscapes, so if you plan on zooming\\nin on the shot later, or if you\\'re one of the\\nthree people on earth who will actually print\\na smartphone photo, this should work, but\\nyou should also be aware that it\\'s only really able to give you these types of\\nresults in excellent lighting where a ton of light is hitting every individual little pixel. Anything short of that, and you\\'re gonna get a\\nlot of noise really quick. And there\\'s also a\\nreally solid shutter lag as it turns out these massive\\n40, 50 megabyte files, granted this mode is mostly\\nfor things sitting still, like a landscape or a photo\\nshoot but worth noting. I think the better compromise is you actually also\\nget a 50-megapixel mode, which kicks out still very detailed images that hang right with the iPhone\\'s\\n48-megapixel ProRAW shots in a variety of light, but now\\nthe files are five megabytes, and there\\'s a lot of less shutter lag. But there\\'s still that improved detail over the normal binge shots\\nand not as much noise. It\\'s all about flexibility. The standard mode is gonna be the best for most shots most of the time, but you can always turn\\nit up if you want to, and that\\'s very much the\\nsame thing with the zoom. You see all the cameras on the back. Any phone with two\\ndifferent telephoto cameras is gonna have the biggest\\nrange of good zoom performance. On this phone, anything past 10X is where it really shines\\ncompared to others. And you might have even\\nseen my recent clip of taking a photo of\\nthe full moon recently, which seems to blow people\\'s\\nminds every time they see it. Wow, but you also can\\'t\\nforget about video too. This is improved video across the board with better processing, the new sensors, and the much better stabilization,\\nthanks to the better OIS. So this might be the\\nbest super steady mode I\\'ve ever seen in smartphone video, and the beauty of it being\\nfrom optical stabilization is it works great in\\na variety of lighting, unlike some electronic\\nimage stabilization, which relies on having a ton of light. And on top of all of that, the 8K video on this\\nsmartphone is very usable. There are previous phones\\nthat have had 8K video, it\\'s not the first, but I remember when they\\nfirst got that capability, they\\'d always be at like 24 FPS, \\'cause that\\'s the most\\nthat they could churn out, which is not the right frame\\nrate, so 8K/30 really good. And if you put it\\nside-by-side with the 4K, you can actually see\\nthe sharpness difference if you really punch in. If you want a sample of this, the latest Auto Focus\\nvideo I shot in my car is in 8K from this phone, and you can actually go watch\\nit 8K on YouTube right now from the link below, hit that\\nlike button if you want to. Oh yeah, and also, don\\'t forget about the better selfies too. There\\'s a new 12 megapixel selfie camera in all these S23 phones. And while that number is lower on paper than the 40 megapixel selfie camera that came before it, it\\'s better. It\\'s just better, rock solid proof that the megapixels don\\'t matter. This selfie camera, with the\\nbetter software processing, is very sharp, detailed, has nice color, doesn\\'t flare too much, and\\nalso has a decently wide angle. It\\'s not ultra-wide but not bad. So across the board, this is significant, an extensive improvement to the camera, especially the primary camera. That feels overlooked to me when people have been reviewing the phone. The one thing I still will complain about is there is still shutter lag, which is different from\\nslow shutter speed. So the time gap between\\nhitting the shutter button and actually capturing the\\nphoto, it\\'s still real, and it can still be kind of annoying, even if you capture a crisp\\nphoto of the wrong moment. So, like I said, it\\'s more pronounced when you take the ultra\\nhigh resolution 50-megapixel or 200-megapixel photos. You can\\'t exactly do those in rapid fire. But if the question is, \"Did they make a meaningful improvement \"to last year\\'s phone to end up here?\" I would say between the new chip and the better overall performance, and much better efficiency, which gets you huge\\nbattery life improvement, and the new cameras\\nwith the better sensors, better processing, but also\\nmuch better stabilization, I would say yes, not upgrade\\nfrom last year\\'s phone, yes, but they\\'ve actually\\nmade a real improvement. And then, I don\\'t really need\\nto say too much about the rest because it\\'s the same as before, which, in the case of the\\nbest big phone of last year, is kind of a good thing. All the other things that\\nmade this the best big phone are still here, and they\\'re\\nnot minor things either. I haven\\'t even talked\\nabout the A+ display, 1440P, 120Hz LTPO, 1,750\\nnits peak brightness, it\\'s still awesome,\\nstill has great speakers, still has very reliable software with a pretty good track record now of delivering software updates in a timely fashion for a while. The base storage has\\nalso actually jumped up from 128 to 256 gigs, and it\\'s\\nfaster UFS 4.0 storage now. It still has the best stylus\\nin a smartphone in the world, which might mean a lot more\\nto you than it does to me, but, honestly, if I ever use it, it\\'s nice knowing I can at any time mark up a screenshot or sign a PDF. And the list goes on, great haptic motor, nice clicky buttons, it\\'s all still here. This thing sets the standard pretty high. My analogy that I was making is that it feels like the\\nportion 9/11 of smartphones. If you\\'re gonna charge\\n1200 bucks for a phone, it better set high marks all\\nthe way across the board, but it does, and it\\'s pretty underrated, kind of boring, but it does. Now, if you want the S23 Ultra to look as improved as it actually is, I would recommend a skin from\\nchannel sponsored, dbrand, maybe something like this Damascus skin, which adds a lot of character, where it would ordinarily be pretty blank. My favorite one is the Triple Black. It is actually included for free when you pick up any of\\nthe holographic colorways, so you can check \\'em\\nout at the link below. I say this phone is boring, and I think maybe understated\\nis the better word. Are there gonna be other\\nphones that come out this year that do one up this phone in\\ncertain single categories? Yeah, 100%, there\\'s probably gonna be a phone with 120X zoom. There\\'s probably gonna be a\\nphone with crazy fast charging. This is only 45 watt charging.\\nDo I wish this was better? A little bit, sometimes. Is there gonna be a phone probably with a much bigger, better,\\nfaster fingerprint reader? (soft bright music)\\nYeah, probably. But as far as just nailing all\\nthe marks across the board, yeah, this does it. Just as far as overall package, Samsung\\'s software is settled,\\nthe screen is sublime, it\\'s still the sickest stylus, and it\\'s snaps significantly\\nsmoother shots, sick. Thanks for watching, catch you\\nguys in the next one, peace. (bright music continues)'}\n",

time I picked up Samsung's new Galaxy s23 Ultra I thought oh no this is the first time in Samsung's entire history where their Pinnacle Flagship smartphone looks almost identical to the one that came before it same body same display same battery Samsung has always been the innovator and so the idea that this company has just gone an entire year without being able to improve the core design from their last phone is scary because does that mean they feel like they've perfected it is this just what all of their phones are going to look like from now on plus how have they still not managed to trim that chin at the bottom why is the selfie camera been demoted from 40 megapixels to just 12. why are the colors of the phone so boring and samey and most importantly why is it noticeably more expensive but now that I've had some time to think about it I've calm down and I've learned a few important details about this phone that have turned my fear and my disappointment into genuine excitement the Galaxy s23 Ultra is worth your attention and these are the 10 reasons why it actually takes better selfies while the resolution has been been downgraded from the s22 ultra the quality of the front camera has gone up leading to more accurate skin tones more reliable focusing and a little bit more detail the s23 ultra has more storage 256 gigabytes versus 128 so while the price of Entry has gone up all the companies really done is just slashed the base level 128 gigabyte model that you used to be able to get which I don't love it makes the phone even less accessible but I think it makes sense given that we're talking about a media Centric phone that can shoot proper 8K video I think it's about time Samsung stopped pretending that 128 gigs of non-expandable storage is actually sufficient but the reason why I'm calling storage a win is that this is no ordinary 256 gigabytes this is the fastest flash memory in the world meaning that even compared to phones from just a few months ago this thing can read and write files almost two times faster while consuming less power and all you have to do is to open up a few apps on your home screen to see that extra responsiveness in action plus if you are offloading huge files directly to your computer you would feel it there too now Samsung's also upgraded the speakers which I think is quite important because this is something they haven't really touched since 2018 with the Galaxy Note 9. they used to be top of the game Samsung used to have some of the best speakers that you could get on a phone and so I'm excited that they're trying to reclaim the reputation they once had they bumped up the volume but what I think I'll notice more is the bass the fullness it's almost surprising you don't expect this amount of it to come out of a package so tiny okay so as with every new Samsung phone you also get to play with a new piece of software so in the case of the s23 you get Samsung's one UI 5.1 skin based on Android 13. it's a pretty thin update you're not gonna lie you basically get routines that can trigger a series of actions based on your activities so whether you're sleeping or exercising or driving Etc one cool thing which means that your Bixby assistant on this phone can respond to incoming calls by just sending back a text and I know Bixby was a bit of a laughing stock when it first came out but we tested it recently and honestly it surprised me and clearly a lot of you guys too more importantly though when it comes to software the key thing that has to be said is that Samsung has become a bit of an unexpected hero with updates there was a time when buying a Samsung Flagship meant you'd get two years of Android updates and you'd almost definitely be one of the last to get those updates but if you look at their current track record in the last couple of years something is getting out all of those smaller security patches faster than basically anyone and right out of the gate they're also promising four full years of major Android version upgrade too so this phone is going to be supported all the way to Android 17 which is a really significant differentiator if you're planning to keep the phone for that long okay it's time to talk about this design and I know my first impression was to cry myself to sleep I just think it's really good when companies try new things and historically if you could rely on any company to do that that would be Samsung but having taken a step back and really thought about it the similarity may not be the worst thing I mean for starters no one's upgrading their phone every single year anymore so this is still going to feel new for someone upgrading from a two to three to four year old Samsung phone plus like I've tested a lot of phones where from the outside they look like complete generational leaps from their predecessors but then you use them and you almost feel cheated because they're pretty much the exact same thing just in a new set of clothes so this phone looking similar to the last might actually help prevent that feeling and people feeling like they need to buy something that they definitely don't need but I think the most important thing and probably the real reason that Samsung kept the design language the same is to let their other phones catch up last year's s22s were a bit kooky you had the s22 ultra which split the cameras into multiple individual modules like this and then the s22 and s22 plus which just had one big camera module and so by this time keeping the design similar on the ultra model but updating the normal s23 and s23 plus they've now at least got a lineup that looks cohesive but also if you look closer it actually is an upgraded design it's a little boxier both the phone and the S Pen that still comes included which I think is an aesthetic perk as well as a functional one because they've sharpened it up in a way that the phone is actually more comfortable to hold instead of less comfy I guess I'm glad that they haven't just copied Apple's design like so many companies have they've retained some of the curve on the screen which is good because it lets your fingers Glide onto the display panel from the sides but they've made it somewhat less curved which means you get more usable flat area of the screen before it starts to slope off it's a really good careful balance and also Samsung swapped out the Corning gorilla glass victus plus that their phones used to be coated in for Gorilla Glass victus 2 which is a really interesting material because it's the first time that this Corning company is really acknowledging the fact that most of the time when you drop your phone it's not from a perfect angle on some smooth laboratory floor phones need to be able to withstand rough surfaces like concrete and there's some quite impressive test footage of it in action which I will not be recreating it's not on purpose and they've managed to achieve that drop protection while also making this display out of 22 recycled glass which is something that I did want to touch on for a minute Samsung is making a real deal about their commitment to the environment and how this phone has parts from recycled water bottles and fishing nets and recycled aluminum but there are plenty of great reasons to buy these new phones I don't think this is one of them like they talked about how they could maybe theoretically reduce up to 15 Tons of waste plastic in the oceans by the end of the year but these are such tiny numbers in the scheme of things like I did the math of this and this is the equivalent of Samsung for every 1 000 smartphone sold donating about 0.004 dollars for manual ocean cleanup so it's great that they're doing more and more of this Eco stuff but I'm just saying remember that if Eco is what you're after the most eco-friendly thing is by far still to just buy a used one or to not buy one okay so if you've been following Samsung's phones at all for the last few years you'll know that camera zoom has become a big part of their strategy well that's better here too sort of so if you look at the spec sheet you won't see a difference at all the s23 ultra's got the same combination of a three times optical zoom camera and a 10 times optical zoom camera and the same max range as last time of 100 times total Zoom but what I was told is that thanks to the new processor in this phone more on that in a minute it'll be able to use powerful AI to still majorly step up the end quality of the zoom shots so I tried it and I was surprised to see that if anything my s22 ultra was actually getting slightly sharper results so I tried it again same thing I even looped in a Samsung employee thinking I was doing something wrong and we ended up in this kind of hilarious kind of concerning situation where he sort of agreed that my s22 ultra shot did look better so if what you'd be wanting to do is randomly zooming into objects and buildings hundreds of meters away I don't think the s23 ultra is going to do much more than the s22 ultra but then we tested it on people and the difference was absolutely enormous I'm imagining this is where the AI in the new chip is doing its most work but I will test this properly in a camera test coming soon so if you do want to see a 100 time zoom shot at Milo's nostrils then a sub to the channel would be sensational [Music] now this leads us to the elephant in the room what I imagine will become the entire tagline of the s23 ultra it's 200 megapixel main camera this is a really important jump but not for the reason you think see actually trying to take full 200 megapixel photos from a tiny camera like this is generally going to be a pretty fruitless exercise each photo is going to end up as like a 50 megabyte file but even with that compared to a proper 200 megapixel camera that would look something more like this you just can't get enough light into a mini phone one to fill that 200 megapixels of resolution with real detail the actual perk of this sensor comes into play with something called pixel binning there's a good chance you've heard of it but it's the idea of individual smaller noisier pixels being grouped together and collating all of their information into fewer bigger cleaner pixels with the 108 megapixel main camera on the previous s22 Ultra what Samsung was doing is clumping together pixels into three by three grids which means your end photos have a ninth of the total pixel count around 12 megapixels or 2 12 million pixels but that those are 12 million really clean pixels because each is made with the information from nine smaller pixels and so what's interesting about this new 200 megapixel sensor is that it now gives us two really good options you can either stick to a 12 megapixel output but it will now be an even cleaner 12 megapixel output because instead of each pixel being made of nine smaller pixels each will now be made of 16 smaller pixels or you can divide your 200 million pixels into four so you're still getting somewhat clean pixels each using the information from four smaller pixels but you're also still getting a really high 50 megapixel resolution output which might be the perfect Middle Ground hopefully that made sense but if it didn't then all you need to know is that the s23 ultra is going to take really good photos and it's actually not just a resolution thing this new 200 megapixel camera also has a few fancy technical tricks that let it bring in even more light but they are also even more complicated so I'll spell you the details and the single thing that I think is going to make the biggest difference is that it can do all of this faster my three biggest complaints about past Samsung cameras are low light performance video and slow capture time and so what's really exciting is that even with more pixels to be processed the newer camera is capturing photos distinctly quicker than its predecessor this is part of the reason why that face from earlier looked so much more crisp but this is where it starts dialing up because as it turns out Samsung isn't just addressing this wonky weakness but in fact all three of its past camera's key weaknesses so you know how this camera can now make these clusters of 16 pixels the biggest place we're going to notice that is in low light shots the lower the light the lower the quality the information that each individual pixel can pick up and so the more benefit there is to multiple pixels grouping together we've had a few side-by-side low light shots and there is definitely more texture and a little better control over the super bright spots which is really important for nighttime cityscapes and so I actually guessed to see what's going to happen when you pair that with the new astro photo mode Samsung's added that optimizes capturing Starry Skies night sky shots are one of my favorite tests to run on any new phone and so knowing that they've specifically optimized for it now this is where it starts to get juicy the cherry on top is that Samsung has also worked with Snapchat Facebook Instagram Tick Tock to integrate this updated night mode and the different Zoom cameras into those apps so when you're zooming in on Tick Tock for example you won't just be using digital Zoom like you used to have to do and then you guessed it Samsung seems to finally be getting serious when it comes to video too which benefits from the light Gathering ability and faster focusing of the new sensor it benefits from the real-time noise reduction thanks to the higher intelligence of this new chip it benefits from an optical image stabilization system that has two times the range of motion and therefore ability to stabilize compared to last year if this ends up being as big of a jump as it felt like in my first impressions I'll be a very happy man like Samsung's video quality is one of the only reasons that I constantly keep an iPhone with me at all times I spent a decent amount of time messing with the new stabilization too and this is a real jump this Rivals those proper gimbal stabilized cameras and objects are noticeably less blurry in motion because of it oh yeah and the other spin-off effect of this new camera Hardware is that 8K video is actually usable now it used to be capped at the quite janky looking 24 frames per second and also not able to use the full camera sensor but now I can run a smooth 30 frames per second which is the frame rate that this video is shot at and because the new sensor is not just better but also more suited for AK it'll finally be able to use the sensor's entire area leading to a higher quality less zoomed in video this feels like the turning point to which many people will start shooting their phone content in 8k I probably won't but some definitely will so what is even more important than all of that well it's this chip I've been referencing the entire video for the last 10 years Samsung's been fitting their phones with Snapdragon chips for the US and India and then their own in-house exynos chips for Europe and Africa and it doesn't seem to matter how much they tried or how many times they claimed to have finally fixed it exynos was almost always a significantly worse chip in terms of both the battery life and the performance so the fact that this time around Samsung has finally ditched exynos giving every single s23 purchaser a brand new 2023 Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip means that I can finally rest in peace Gen 2 chip means that I can finally sleep in peace the first time in a decade to check out the 10 gadgets that I actually use every single day of my life that video is here I will see you there\"}\n",

across five cities to show you why this year more than most the burden of fulfilling that Ultra pledge falls to the phone's five cameras and if you're already lamenting yet another YouTuber calling a camera review a phone review hey blame Samsung of the 32 minutes The company took to talk about phones at its launch event 27 of them were devoted to photo and video so for the month plus with my review device I made the decision to leave behind the iPhone that I normally use for the kind of easy b-roll at which it excels and use the ultra in its place I'm talking about capturing the quirks and bugs and general behaviors of another phone in my review queue this one in San Diego I'm talking about filming walk and talk a-roll for a sponsor spot in my apartment documenting my Galaxy flip screen protector replacement at the Samsung store in Manhattan shooting video at a seminar showcasing the potential future of the internet in San Francisco and cataloging new tech vapor and otherwise at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona I used the 23 Ultra to shoot footage of the obligatory Hall wandering social robots I stuck it on a selfie stick to snag some aerial footage of a new phone announcement that amounted to nothing you know what I mean and I shot a quick reaction video and something of a jet-lagged days following some Hands-On time with some pretty wild concept phones now none of these shots were in ideal circumstances I often had to use the ultra wide camera to get everything in the frame in lighting that was never the best and yeah you can see some of that in some of the results but folks this phone's footage has made it to four Mr mobile videos and countless social posts over the past month and the amount of usable footage it's given me far outweighs the stuff I had to leave on The Cutting Room floor the ultra's zoom cameras too come in as handy for my work as they do in the wild for when I really wanted that close-up of the ribbon cutting at a store relaunch [Music] or when I needed to click a pic of Carl pay through a crowd of backpacked bloggers what I kept thinking during my time with the ultra was damn wish I had these cameras on my fold four especially once I started taking it out into the real world at the risk of repeating a bit from my s22 Ultra review I'll say that this footage is not all that impressive Until you realize that I was shooting it from way back here it doesn't get any better than this phone for bird watching whether you're talking the man-made Mechanicals of LAX or the chatty but cute monk parakeets indigenous to Barcelona in San Diego the ultra let me punch in on the World War II vintage USS Midway to find another kind of bird whose tail feathers betrayed that it belonged in fact to a Starship gosh my friend history would that be of course you are at least a more modern aircraft carrier like the USS Abraham Lincoln across the bay if you're neither bird nor boat inclined while the zoom is still handy for terrestrial Pursuits even something as pedestrian is checking how long you might have to wait for breakfast based on the line at the restaurant across from your hotel at lunch when a honey bee alights upon the flowers alongside your table you can keep your distance while still watching it work other phone is capable of this level of detail at these Zoom levels with this degree of stabilization [Music] but maybe you're already saying it all that was true of last year's Ultra too yeah the zoom Optics are basically unchanged the big difference this year is the addition of about 92 million pixels to the main camera the camera you use most of the time now boasts a whopping 200 megapixel sensor that's excessive to put it mildly and by default the phone will bend the output virtually combining 16 pixels into one to produce a 12 megapixel photo that picture will get the benefit of all that rich post-processing Samsung has worked for years to perfect and it will also have a file size that's actually manageable this 12 megapixel photo of planes getting pushed back at LAX four megabytes in size this 200 megapixel photo of the same scene 24 megabytes now zoom into each and you'll see why in the full resolution shot there's enough detail to read the tail number on the plane while in the 12 megapixel image all you get is digital confetti foreign but um does it really matter I mean hyper resolution like this was a big deal back when phones only had one camera because it was required to make digital Zoom actually useful but these days unless you're trying to print huge posters from your photos 200 megapixels is Major Overkill as we've seen if you want to zoom in on the ultra you have excellent telephoto lenses for the purpose and shooting in Full Resolution mode takes a lot longer shot to shot what's more even in Bend mode Samsung doesn't seem to have totally tamed the Beast that is this new sensor capturing moving subjects especially in dim light is still as dicey a proposition as it's ever been and that's something Samsung tacitly acknowledges by making available the camera assistant app it lets you tweak certain settings to prioritize capture speed over quality but this is more stop Gap than solution on top of that there's not always enough dynamic range to deal with a truly challenging scenario and the selfie shooter is not my favorite not by a long shot but when the ultra hits it really Nails it even as an avowed opponent of faux portrait in general I'm very impressed by how well the phone did with my girlfriend's hair which was really being whipped around by the wind here the steadier stabilization makes it my new preferred Android sidekick for video the new astrophotography mode seems promising and I look forward to testing it if I can never get out of a city and the ultra can always fall back on its sheer range its parlor trick of being a camera phone that's also a telescope yeah as I mentioned eighty percent of this video too is about the cameras but thankfully there are a few important improvements outside the Optics as well to it Big Slab like sides that give the 23 a boxier build which makes it easier to grip easier to write on and gives it more internal volume for a bigger battery oh it doesn't have a bigger battery it's still 5000. it's weird it feels like it does that's due to a combination of little reported upgrades that are easy to miss if you're just glancing at the spec sheet among them a display that's just as gorgeous as last year but between 13 and 16 percent more efficient faster lpddr5x Ram that's also more efficient and in every Market on the globe a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor that's more powerful better cooled and you guessed it more efficient when you consider that last year's s22 Ultra was already starting from a very strong battery life position it should be no surprise that I've never seen the low battery screen on this thing it's a true two-day smartphone sadly charging is just as Pokey as we've come to expect from every Samsung but at least it hasn't stripped out the wireless option like many of its china-based competitors deeper than last year's which themselves were even louder and deeper than some laptops I've used [Music] the top shelf specs all add up to Performance that's smoother than I can ever recall seeing on a Samsung what we used to call a buttery software experience from swipe to swipe and the whole thing is wrapped in Gorilla Glass victus 2 which is designed for better drop resistance even given the probable increase in scratch vulnerability as a result because you know physics I think that's probably a good thing because this corner really does dig into your palm when you're going one-handed and I found this brick like is just a fumble away from Doom should you drop it to your concrete floor to paraphrase the old sailor's adage when using the 23 Ultra keep one hand for the phone and the other hand also for the phone oh and because it is called a phone I should mention that yes it also makes phone calls they're good finally there's our old friend the S Pen and by old I mean totally unchanged yeah there are no new features to speak of here the same useful but stale collection of capabilities from magnification to translation to Conjuring digital art from The Ether and the same damn wobble thanks to those cameras but mainly I just use it to scribble things I can't be ours to wrestle with Evernote just to jot down or for more Precision in a photo editing app when I want to eliminate dust specs or make other tweaks to photos also I I do still like that I can use it as a magic wand for the camera at the very least it's a great way to work out nervous energy the s23 ultra is available in a variety of dull colors that do nothing to convey how powerful it actually is and some samsung.com exclusive colors that catch the eye slightly better but if none of those Hues are doing it for you do what I do and debrand it this video is sponsored by my old friends at dbrand whose real leather phone skins just don't get old well actually I suppose the whole point is they do and they age beautifully gracefully developing a patina that shows everyday dings and scratches in a very elegant totally unique way and even if leather isn't your look they've got tons of options for tons of products so debrand your device at the link in the description 1200 bucks that's what the 23 Ultra costs to start with but if you're using the camera a lot and you will be you probably want to step it up to 1380 for more storage 256 gigs to start is great but over my five weeks of usage I've already filled up 25 of that so yeah go for the half terabyte if you can is it worth it well as always I'm going to assume the person asking is actually in the market for a top shelf smartphone specifically one that's camera Centric because in my view this is the most adaptable most capable camera on Android and you know we can remove that platform qualifier as long as the iPhone doesn't have a 10x optical zoom also if you already own the 22 Ultra you can ride this one out and even most 21 Ultra owners will probably still be all right but if you're coming from an older phone or the iPhone or you just want the absolute best of what Android slabs can offer the s23 ultra is the most powerful most consistent one of those on the market those in search of something that will actually give you more Utility change the way you think about a smartphone well that's what the Galaxy flip and fold and their ever-growing catalog of competitors are for and I'll be bringing you more news from that world very soon this video was produced following five weeks with a Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra review sample provided by Samsung but as always the manufacturer had no editorial input copy approval rights or rights of any kind into the production of this content it didn't even get an early preview Samsung is seeing this for the first time right alongside you please subscribe to the Mr Mobile on YouTube if you'd like to see more videos like this when they eventually get published three weeks later than I intended to thanks for your

speakingof bad softwarepixel watch uh that's for another video[Music]\", 'start': 600, 'end': 633}], 'full_transcript': \" these pixel 7 devices they're surprisingly good this year I'd go so far as to argue that these are probably the best Android phones you can get on the market and it's not just like specs and benchmarks that they've bumped up in it's just real Improvement just real usability that makes these special so the colors I have here are the pixel 7 and lemongrass and the pixel 7 Pro in Hazel now this device with its polished aluminum seems to scratch quite easily so I've purposely kept this thing away from keys or anything that could scratch either the screen or the back glass or this metal area but I've picked up three or four distinct like Cuts in that material and it kind of makes sense it is Aluminum it's not the hardest metal but I did find it a little bit disappointing that this is like a week and a half old and it's already got Nicks in it so if you care about this stuff you're gonna have to protect with a case or something like a skin or something because I think over time this is going to scratch heavily for most people unless you protect it now in terms of the sizing the pixel 7 is actually a little bit smaller this year than the pixel 6 from last year it's got a slightly smaller screen the bezel's a little bit thinner and the device is ever so slightly easier to hold because it's just fractionally more compact but it's still a relatively large phone but if you compared to like the 7 Pro this is a big boy phone like a real big boy phone and this is almost identical in footprint to the pixel 6 Pro but there is something interesting going with the screens so the 7 Pro screen is a lot brighter than expected it's definitely brighter than the one in the six Pro but it's even significantly brighter than the one on the seven and I'm surprised that Google didn't kind of Market this differently because during the presentation the official stance is that these are 25 brighter at Peak compared to the previous generation so the 7 Pro can hit up to 1500 nits and the Seven connect to 1400 nits but if you're looking at just manually controlled brightness this is a way brighter screen this year compared to what we saw last year and compared to the seven so bright screens matter to you 7 Pro is the move this year uh there is also now front-facing cameras for no that's a lie there's always front-facing cameras there's now front-facing cameras that can be used for Face Unlock it's fast but there's a couple couple things to note first it needs light it needs light for the initial setup but also needs light to activate it like I was in a dark restaurant pulled it out tried to do the face unlock didn't go I had to use my fingerprint uh it just doesn't have like infrared or any kind of the radar Tech from Pixel 4. secondly because it's a fairly simple face unlock system you can't lean on it for kind of sensitive apps so like banking apps or password apps that require proper authentication it won't do it so it's useful the fact that like it's been a couple years since we've had Face Unlock at all on a pixel it's nice but it's not like top tier facial Biometrics now in terms of the fingerprint sensor last year's pixel 6 devices had relatively slow unlock speeds it wasn't like the worst thing out there but if you compared to the other flagships out there it was on the slower side this year's device unfortunately is quite similar I wouldn't say that it's like slow but I mean it's If You Gotta Wait an eighth of a second to get in okay that time seven was a lot faster but in general they're quite similar so if you're someone who found the six to be unbearably slow on the fingerprint unlock last year I don't think the pixel 7 is significantly better at least not to me uh now in terms of the screens themselves the pixel 7 still has a 90 Hertz screen the pixel 7 Pro has a 120 hertz screen nice panel this year but it's still like a generation one ltpo panel so I'll go down to 10 Hertz to preserve battery life instead of like the one Hertz so you can see on like some of the Samsung and Apple flagships but yeah good screen this year now in terms of the haptics both devices have great haptics this year last year the 6 Pro had stronger feeling vibrations than the six because of the position or like the location of the motor they seem to have repositioned it this year so now both phones have the same haptic strength uh the speakers don't seem like they've changed this year the Seven Pro sounds better than the seven and they sound basically identical to their counterparts last year at least to me now the camera systems so this year the 7 and 7 Pro both use the same main shooter as a 6 Pro from last year these seven gets the updated ultrawide the 7 Pro gets an ultra wide as well as a 5x Optical telephoto the main lens on both of the new pixels actually feel quite similar to last year's six Pros both in sharpness and dynamic range it's very good but I'm not seeing significant improvements from the previous generation I'd actually say that the iPhone 14 pro and the s22 ultra shoot sharper images on the main lens the coloring was very pixel-like it's got that pop that pixel photos often have especially with low light photos pixel just does that amping up of colors I think it looks nice but it's not exactly what I would call Natural per se if that's what you're looking for but low light shots are a lot faster this year it really is double the speed in terms of capturing a night sight photo the ultra wide lens also handles tough shots way better so better dynamic range better in low light it's just a nicer looking shot and sharper than it was in previous generations now the 7 Pro has a macro functionality so if you're just using the regular camera you get close enough to a subject it'll automatically switch to the ultrawide and focus it in manner to capture really fine detail on close objects very cool but the pixel 7 doesn't have that functionality unfortunate now in terms of the zoom that is where the biggest difference lies this here so on the 7 Pro you get a really nice 5x Optical it goes to about 10x while retaining nice image quality even in low light but once you go beyond that it's like 20 and 30X it starts to degrade to a point where I don't think it's a particularly nice image but overall that telephoto capability is quite nice and even on the seven the fact that they're cropping the image in to get that 2x Zoom it just makes for better image quality in those punched in shots now in terms of video quality it's really good this year I don't feel like pixels have had like excellent video quality over the years it's definitely better this year the stabilization is smooth with nice image quality proper focusing there is that new cinematic blur feature but it doesn't do it for me I feel like the racking is off and it just feels extreme really artificial when I use it but maybe it'll improve over time there's also that new magic unblur feature very cool it can fix certain types of blurred shots so if like the subject moved or if the camera moved while you took the shot and it kind of blurred it like that it can do that sometimes but if you took a shot and it was out of focus it can't like reassemble that into a focus shot at least I don't think it can do that but it is one of the new features that the tensor G2 chip allows the pixel 7 device to do that the pixel 6 devices couldn't do there's also this really cool clear calling feature that is very good the bathroom is probably where I give my deepest and most creative thing the bathroom is probably where you went deepest and most creative thinking the bathroom is probably where I do my teeth and most creative thinking it's noise suppression technology that uses their hardware and it works really well and it's Unique to pixel and to me this is the best part of what these pixel phones can do this year it's like strange how effective that is right and for someone that makes calls like I make calls in Fairly noisy environments quite often like sometimes I have to do meetings with kids like screaming in the background this is so useful I like it a lot and I think most people if you make calls ever we'll find use for that in some point the assistive voice typing is still really cool and call screening Works reasonably well in Canada it's not as good as it is in the States but overall the kind of unique pixel features are just better this year because of that new chip now performance on that G2 is faster as you would expect right but the most interesting conversation to me is around thermals and battery life so last year on the G1 tensor G1 the thermal performance was not amazing if you played games or pushed any kind of app that utilized the CPU and GPU hard you'd get some throttling quite aggressively this year the G2 has noticeably better thermals so if you throw it in gentian it's able to maintain Max performance quite a bit longer than the G1 it's still made on Samsung's five nanometer node so it's not like the most efficient stuff out there but it's definitely better but battery life unfortunately has not gotten better at least not from my testing so I ran the same test as I did last year and on the 7 Pro I'm getting roughly the same kind of run time as I did last year on the 6 Pro but the 7 does seem to have slightly shorter battery life this year than the six from last year but I think your mileage is going to vary depending on how you use these phones but I did try to keep the parameters the same between the the devices this year and last year okay so pricing real quickly the thing that makes the pixel devices special to me is really the price to have a 900 Flagship and a 600 kind of semi Flagship is just awesome I feel like they have a fairly refined phone this year they took what works with the pixel 6 kind of tuned some things tightened up the camera system tightened up the overall hardware and just made a it's just really good overall product and you get the five years of support so you get three years of software updates and another two years of security updates I think the it's just a really nice phone this year I will leave this review off with like one thought just something I just got to get off my chest okay so last year when I had the pixel 6 devices I really liked them on my review and I used the pixel 6 not the pro the pixel 6 as my main phone and it had issues it

as a reviewer to look at this hardware and be like this is good when I had weird stuff happening with units last year so I will say that with Google's devices it's hard to really gauge the long term kind of experience okay sometimes you get these updates that just destroy everything like that happens to my pixel 6 and sometimes you get really solid devices so I can only review this because I've only had this for like a week and a bit I can only review this from the perspective of right now but I think that these will be the phone of the year for a lot of people these are really solid special the camera systems it's just I hope Google doesn't screw this thing up because bad software can really ruin devices like this speaking of bad software pixel watch uh that's for another video

The author finds the joy of the iPhone comes from the ecosystem and convenience of features, and that many apps are better optimized for the device. The review was produced following 21 days with an iPhone 14 Pro, with no creative control or editorial input from Apple.\n",
      "The Verge  Apple's new iPhone 14 Pro features a dynamic island instead of the notch, a photonic engine, an always-on display, eSIM, and satellite connectivity. It has improved battery life and camera features, such as Pro Raw mode and 4K Cinematic Mode. It is a good choice for those who want to be on the bleeding edge, but others may want to wait until the features are more complete.\n",
      "Marques Brownlee  The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is an upgraded version of the S22 Ultra, with a boxier design, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy chip. It has a 5,000 mAh battery, a 200-megapixel primary camera with double the optical image stabilization range, and two telephoto cameras. It also has a 50-megapixel mode, 8K video, and a 12-megapixel selfie camera. It has 45 watt charging, A+ display, 1440P, 120Hz LTPO, 1,750 nits peak brightness, reliable software, UFS 4.0 storage, the best stylus in a smartphone, a great haptic motor, nice clicky buttons, and a free Triple Black skin with the holographic colorways.\n",
      "Mrwhosetheboss  Samsung's new S23 Ultra phone has a boxier design and is coated in Gorilla Glass Victus 2. It has a 200 megapixel camera with 16 smaller pixels per pixel, allowing for cleaner 12 megapixel output, and improved video capabilities such as real-time noise reduction, optical image stabilization, and a wider range of motion. It also has a three times optical zoom camera and a 10 times optical zoom camera, with a max range of 100 times total zoom, and is optimized for low light shots and night sky shots. It is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, which provides better battery life and performance.\n",
      "MrMobile [Michael Fisher]  Michael Fisher tested the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra across five cities for five weeks and found it to be a powerful, camera-centric smartphone with a 200 megapixel main camera, telephoto lens, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and an unchanged S Pen. It is a great two-day smartphone and is worth the upgrade for those who use the camera a lot. It does not have a 10x optical zoom, but those looking for a phone that will change the way they think about smartphones should look into the Galaxy Flip and Fold and its competitors.\n",
      "The Verge  The Samsung S23 series has a unified design, improved materials, and upgraded cameras and batteries. The S23 Ultra has a 200 megapixel main camera sensor, a reshaped screen, and 256GB of base storage. The S23 Plus and S23 have an upgraded 12 megapixel selfie camera and bigger batteries. The camera bump is a controversial feature, and viewers are encouraged to comment their opinion.\n",
      "Dave2D  The Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are the best Android phones on the market this year, with improved specs, benchmarks, and usability. The 7 Pro has a brighter screen, a front-facing camera for Face Unlock, and improved features such as an ultra wide lens, macro functionality, 5x optical zoom, and improved video quality. The Pixel 4 has a simple face unlock system and a fingerprint sensor similar to last year's Pixel 6. The Pixel G2 has improved thermals and a faster processor, but battery life has not improved. The speaker has only had the Pixel 6 for a week and a bit, but they think it will be the phone of the year for many people.\n",
      "The Verge  The Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are the latest flagship phones from Google, featuring a new design, improved camera, 5G, IP68 rating, face unlock, Google's custom chipset, Tensor G2, and voice and helper features such as Direct My Call. The Pixel 7 has addressed some of the weaknesses of the Pixel 6, with faster unlocking, a more competitive camera, and a more appealing design. It has also added features such as Photo Blur and Magic Eraser, as well as a cinematic blur mode for video.\n",
      "Marques Brownlee  The Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro are the latest phones from Google, with improved hardware and software solutions such as the Tensor G2 chip, Call Screening, Home Screen Search, Face Unlock, and Recorder app. They have excellent cameras with 50 megapixel primary cameras, an ultra-wide camera with autofocus, and a 5x 48 megapixel telephoto camera. The Pixel 7 Pro is a great phone for photography, but is slightly behind the iPhone when it comes to noise levels and autofocus. The Pixel 7 is a great value phone and is recommended for those who prefer pristine programming and pretty pictures.\n",
      "MrMobile [Michael Fisher]  The Google Pixel 7 Pro is a great phone with many features, such as a 5x telephoto camera, Magic Eraser, call screening, and astrophotography mode. It is optimized for the tensor chipset and is great for capturing still images. It also has exclusive features such as Speakly, a language learning app, and baggage claim notification. Despite its average battery life and slow charging speeds, it is still a great phone for a good price.\n"
